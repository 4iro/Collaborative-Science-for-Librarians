<p>Using correct names and pronouns (e.g.Â âshe/herâ) is important to
setting a tone of respect. Learning these is hard to do quickly, so we
recommend displaying it prominently during the workshop.</p>
<p>In an online workshop, give everyone a moment to update their display
name to reflect how they would like to be addressed.</p>
<p>At an in-person event, we recommend supplying name tags and markers,
or using plain paper to create table-displayed name placards.</p>
<p>Note that pronouns are personal and some participants might prefer
not to share them. Do not force people to share their pronouns.</p>

<p>The main objective of this training is to help participants
understand the motivations, principles, and potential benefits of open
science for marginalized communities.</p>
<p>During this training, we will introduce the concepts of open science
and open practices, along with the motivations behind them and the
challenges that many communities face when attempting to implement these
principles. Furthermore, we will elaborate on the concept of digital
accessibility, FAIR principles, and CARE principles, and discuss their
impact on peopleâs participation within the scientific community.
Additionally, we will showcase various open science initiatives in Latin
America and the diverse practices they employ to overcome the barriers
faced by marginalized communities in the context of science and
education.</p>
<p>By the end of this training, the participants will have acquire
information that will allow them to assess the levels of accessibility
of different digital resources and virtual events. They will also be
equipped to apply best practices for fostering a more inclusive research
network for non-native English speakers.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The declaration of 2023 as the Year of Open Science by NASA and other
federal US agencies reflects the belief that open science is a pillar to
ensure information access and the democratization of the scientific
process.</p>
<p>As Chelle Gentemann, program scientist for NASAâs Transform to Open
Science (TOPS) mission, recently shared in Nature,</p>
<p><em>âI realized that open science isnât just about tools.
Open-science innovation is being driven by a global community with
diverse perspectives. The scientific questions are more interesting and
nuanced, the solutions betterâ</em></p>
<p>Open science communities and organizations serve as platforms where
researchers and societal stakeholders converge to achieve results that
are not only technically sound but also socially significant. This is
made possible through the application of transparent, reproducible, and
verifiable methods, engaging contributors from diverse regions,
disciplines, and social contexts. However, non-native English-speaking
researchers, educators, and professionals often encounter challenges in
accessing the resources necessary to conduct their work, primarily due
to limited funding, language barriers, and geographical constraints.</p>
<p>Our objective is to shed light on how open science communities,
particularly those in marginalized regions like Latin America, actively
engage in implementing, teaching, and disseminating open practices and
resources. Drawing upon experiences from Spanish-speaking communities of
practice, we aim to collaborate with librarians to explore the specific
challenges faced by these communities when dealing with data and other
resources primarily available in English, which creates a language-based
accessibility barrier. Through these discussions, we intend to address
how open science practices can aid marginalized communities of scholars
in overcoming obstacles related to language, socioeconomic status, and
other factors, ultimately fostering a more inclusive scientific
community.</p>

<p>Librarians play an indispensable role in advancing open science as
facilitators, supporting researchers, and significantly contributing to
the principles of collaboration and inclusivity. These values are
crucial as they enable global participation in scientific endeavors,
ultimately contributing to the democratization of knowledge.
Additionally, they aid in combating the spread of misinformation and
disinformation, addressing systemic inequalities, and challenging the
monopolization of wealth, knowledge, and power. Furthermore, they guide
scientific efforts toward addressing pressing social issues.</p>
<p>Throughout this lesson, we will explore the implications of adopting
more open and ethical research practices, establishing an environment
where scientific information is accessible to all, and increasing the
visibility and impact of scientific publications. Itâs important to
acknowledge that open science presents challenges, and librarians must
be proactive in addressing these obstacles to ensure that it does not
exacerbate existing barriers.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The core aspects of Open Science are closely related to Article 27 of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations, which
acknowledges peopleâs right to participate in scientific progress and
enjoy its benefits. Open Science aims to make science accessible and
collaborative for the benefit of society as a whole, aligning with this
right.</p>

<p>While there are several definitions of open science, in this lesson,
we will follow the one provided by the UNESCO recommendations for Open
Science which states that it is a movement aimed at enhancing
accessibility, efficiency, democracy, and transparency in scientific
research.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This approach is underpinned by unprecedented advancements in digital
technology and seeks to make information, data, and research findings
more accessible through open access and more reliable through open
data.</p>
<p>A fundamental component is the active participation of all
stakeholders, including society at large, to foster increased
collaboration and transparency in the field of science. It seeks to
involve social actors beyond the traditional scientific community by
opening up the processes of creating, evaluating, and communicating
scientific knowledge.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Although many researchers use these terms interchangeably, and we
will do so in this lesson, a <em>replication</em> is a study where an
independent group of researchers reproduces the methodologies of
previous work, collects the data, and analyzes it following the
procedures of the original study to see if they reach the same results.
It assesses the consistency and generalizability of the findings. A
<em>reproduction</em>, on the other hand, occurs when a group of
independent researchers analyzes data previously collected by a
different group, using those researchersâ analysis plan, to determine if
they reach the same result. It verifies the validity of the
findings.</p>
<p>Reproducibility and replicability are among the core objectives of
science. However, for this to be possible, researchers need to describe
their methods and processes in ways that others can repeat them. Open
science practices make it possible for scientists to share the different
stages of their workflow, making them accessible to other
researchers.</p>

<p>Open science involves an unavoidable cultural shift. It ensures that
research processes, methods, and data are transparent and easily
accessible to others. This transparency facilitates the verification and
reproducibility of research, enhancing the reliability of scientific
findings.</p>
<p>Open science practices can reduce barriers between researchers and
other stakeholders, such as the public, policymakers, and practitioners,
by offering them access to the different stages of the research
workflow. This engagement has the potential to foster public trust in
science and promote decision-making based on evidence.</p>

</h3>
<p>English is one of the most widely spoken and understood languages
globally, which is why using English as a common language increases the
accessibility of scientific research to a broader international audience
and allows researchers from diverse linguistic backgrounds to
collaborate and communicate effectively.</p>
<p>However, while English serves as a valuable interchange language,
making it the dominant language of science has a negative impact on
non-English-speaking communities.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="the-bias-produced-by-the-language-gap">The Bias Produced by the Language Gap<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-bias-produced-by-the-language-gap"></a>
</h4>
<p>For those whose native language is not English, the language is a
barrier to participating fully in discussions, publishing research, or
collaborating with English-speaking researchers. This can lead to the
underrepresentation of valuable contributions. It also hinders the
understanding and engagement of individuals with science.</p>
<p>Language is deeply intertwined with culture. By prioritizing English,
we risk embedding cultural biases into scientific knowledge,
marginalizing perspectives and practices from non-English-speaking
regions. It can also reinforce power dynamics favoring English-speaking
countriesâ interests and priorities rather than reflecting the global
spectrum of challenges and needs. It can influence decision-making,
funding allocation, and the overall direction of scientific
research.</p>
<p>For non-English-speaking communities, learning the language is often
reserved for people in a privileged position. Not everyone has equal
access to the resources needed to acquire a second language. This
creates an inherent bias towards individuals with better access to
educational materials, funds, and even time, further exacerbating global
inequalities in scientific participation and representation.</p>
<p>At the same time, translation is a laborious and costly process that
most often falls on the non-English speaker. One common practice in
scientific journals in different languages is the translation of
abstracts into English to enhance the visibility of the work and
accessibility for individuals who only speak English. This practice is
prevalent in most Latin American and Chinese journals, while it is
extremely infrequent in English-language journals.</p>

<h3 id="the-socio-economic-limitations">The socio-economic limitations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-socio-economic-limitations"></a>
</h3>
<p>Being a researcher in a low to middle-income country (LMIC) can
present several barriers to adopting open science practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited Access to Resources:</li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers in LMICs often lack access to necessary resources such as
high-speed internet, computing infrastructure, software, and relevant
literature. Open science heavily relies on digital platforms and
resources, and the absence of these can hinder their adoption.</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial constraints:</li>
</ul>
<p>Open-access publishing, attending open science-related conferences,
or accessing open educational resources often incur costs and the
financial burden may limit the researchersâ participation in open
science practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of Funding and Support:</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, research funding is scarce. The limited
availability of grants or funding for open science initiatives may
discourage researchers from actively participating or investing time in
adopting these practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of training opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>Awareness and understanding of open science practices may be lacking
or insufficient in LMICs due to limited training opportunities.
Researchers are not often familiar with the benefits or methodologies
associated with open science.</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing Pressures and Incentives:</li>
</ul>
<p>Many academic systems place a high emphasis on publishing in
well-established, often subscription-based, journals. Researchers in
LMICs frequently face pressure to conform to traditional publishing
practices rather than exploring open access options due to concerns
about career progression and recognition.</p>
<ul>
<li>Policy and Institutional Constraints:</li>
</ul>
<p>Some institutions or governments in low to middle-income countries do
not have established policies or frameworks supportive of open science.
The lack of a conducive environment or encouragement from the
authorities can impede the integration of open practices.</p>
<p>Addressing these barriers necessitates concerted efforts from the
global scientific community, including providing financial support,
improving digital infrastructure, offering training programs, promoting
multilingualism, and advocating for policies that facilitate open
science adoption in all regions.</p>

high-quality scientific information as those with higher socioeconomic
standing.</p></li>
<li><p>Collaborative research and resource sharing: reduce costs and
overcome barriers, enabling scientists to participate in projects that
may have been individually unaffordable for them. This collaboration not
only promotes inclusion but also harnesses a broader range of knowledge
and experiences through funding, equipment, and expertise, reducing the
burden on individual researchers or institutions with limited
resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Fostering diversity, inclusion, and equitable participation: is
crucial for representing a variety of perspectives and talents
worldwide. Adapting open science practices to local needs and overcoming
economic and cultural barriers is essential. Encouraging the active
participation of individuals with disabilities in collaborative research

<p>Librarians play a crucial role in improving digital accessibility by
providing support, resources, and guidance. There are several ways to
contribute to digital content becoming more inclusive.</p>
<p>Letâs start by identifying some key elements of digital
accessibility:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Text content should be clear, concise, and formatted in a simple
manner. This helps users to easily understand and navigate
information.</p></li>
<li><p>Images should provide alternative text or alt text that describes
the content and function of the image, making them accessible to
individuals who use screen readers or have visual impairments.</p></li>
<li><p>Color combinations should have sufficient contrast to ensure
readability for all users. This is especially important for text and
background colors to accommodate individuals with visual
impairments.</p></li>
<li><p>Videos should include subtitles and audio content. Subtitles
provide a text-based version of spoken content, benefiting individuals
who are deaf or hard of hearing.</p></li>
<li><p>Transcripts for video and audio content should be available.
Transcripts provide a written version of spoken content, making it
accessible to those who prefer to read or need an alternative
format.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are different ways in which librarianâs can contribute to

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>While digital accessibility focuses on making digital content
inclusive and user-friendly, data accessibility is concerned with making
data sets, databases, and research findings open and accessible to
researchers, policymakers, and the public.</p>
<p>Data accessibility involves adopting practices such as the ones
described in the FAIR Principles. These are a set of guidelines and best
practices designed to improve reusability of data, which refers to the
ability to use existing data for different purposes beyond the original
intent of its collection. It involves making data understandable,
well-documented, organized, and stored in a way that allows others to
effectively utilize it in various contexts and for different analyses,
experiments, or applications. The great value of data lies in their
ability to be reusable in order to accelerate scientific discoveries and
save costs in their creation. The FAIR acronym stands for findability,
accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of data (or any digital
object), metadata (information about that digital object), and
infrastructure, particularly in the area of data and scientific
research.</p>
<p>Check out the Go Fair website: <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" class="external-link">https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/</a></p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="data-should-be-findable">Data should be <em>Findable</em>
<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-should-be-findable"></a>
</h3>
<p>The FAIR principles emphasizes that data and associated metadata
should be easily discoverable and accessible by both humans and
computers. This ensures that researchers, scientists, and practitioners
can efficiently locate the data they need for their work.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="a-globally-unique-and-persistent-identifier-for-data-and-metadata">A globally unique and persistent identifier for data and
metadata<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-globally-unique-and-persistent-identifier-for-data-and-metadata"></a>
</h4>
<p>In order to be findable, (Meta) data should have assigned a globally
unique and persistent identifier. These identifiers, which consist of an
internal link, remove ambiguity in the meaning of the published data,
they make it findable, they allow computers to interpret it in a
meaningful way, and they help the people who reuse it to properly cite
it. Many data repositories will automatically generate them when you
store a datasets, but you can also use registry services that use
algorithms to guarantee the uniqueness of the generated identifiers.</p>
<p>A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://orcid.org/" class="external-link">https://orcid.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.doi.org" class="external-link">https://www.doi.org</a></li>
<li><a href="https://identifiers.org" class="external-link">https://identifiers.org</a></li>

<h4 id="the-importance-of-a-descriptive-metadata">The importance of a descriptive metadata<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-importance-of-a-descriptive-metadata"></a>
</h4>
<p>Metadata provide essential context about the data, describing its
content, structure, source, and other pertinent information. Extensive
and descriptive metadata makes it possible to automatize some routine
tasks which currently demand a lot of attention from researchers. For
example, machine-readable metadata enable automated discovery, indexing,
and retrieval of datasets, making it easier for both humans and machines
to locate relevant data efficiently. They should be able to locate any
dataset based on the information provided by their metadata, so the
richer the better! Typically, the metadata and the dataset are stored as
distinct files. It is important to establish a clear link between both
of them by referencing the globally unique and persistent identifier
within the metadata.</p>
<p>Examples of metadata frameworks:</p>

</h4>
<p>Merely having an identifier and detailed metadata is not enough. The
highest quality and most comprehensive datasets or digital resources are
essentially useless if users are unaware of their existence.The process
of ensuring discoverability of digital resources, particularly scholarly
research data, is a critical step in facilitating efficient access and
utilization of valuable information. There are various methods that
address this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Indexing: Utilizing search engine indexing, as demonstrated by
search engines like Google, is a potent method. Search engines send out
crawlers that analyze web content, index it, and make it searchable.
However, for scholarly research data, specialized indexing approaches
tailored to the academic domain are necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Specialized Repositories and Catalogs: Uploading data to
specialized repositories or catalogs relevant to the specific field of
research enhances discoverability within the target audience.
Researchers often turn to these curated platforms to find relevant data
for their projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Cross-Linking and References: Creating links from related
publications, datasets, or similar resources to the target dataset or
resource can significantly boost discoverability. Academic papers that
cite or reference the data also indirectly enhance its
visibility.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="data-should-be-accesible">Data should be <em>Accesible</em>
<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-should-be-accesible"></a>
</h3>
<p>Within the FAIR principles, making the data accessible refers to
making it easily available and retrievable to users and systems. It
implies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clear Access Protocols: the protocol (HTTP, FTP, SMTPâ¦) should be
free (no-cost) and open (-sourced) and thus globally implementable to
facilitate data retrieval and should ensure Metadata is accessible, even
when the data are no longer available</p></li>
<li><p>Data Repositories: Storing data in reputable and accessible
repositories or data centers, which offer standardized access methods
(e.g., APIs, web interfaces), enhances accessibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Standardized Formats: Using widely accepted and standard data
formats, such as Comma-Separated Values files, makes it easier for both
humans and machines to access and interpret the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Compliance with Legal and Ethical Standards: Ensuring that data
access complies with legal, ethical, and privacy standards to protect
sensitive information while enabling appropriate accessibility.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="data-should-be-interoperable">Data should be <em>Interoperable</em>
<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-should-be-interoperable"></a>
</h3>
<p>Data should be easily integrated with other datasets, applications,
workflows of analysis and processing. For this,</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a language to represent information that has precisely defined
syntax and grammar, is shared and accessible so that others can learn
it, and can be used in multiple scenarios (e.g.Â RDF, JSON LD).</li>

can be replicated and/or combined in different settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Described with accurate and relevant details. With a clear and
easy-to-understand license for usage.</li>

<p>To make their findings openly accessible to the public, researchers
have different options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Green Open Access (Green Route):</li>
</ul>
<p>It involves self-archiving or depositing a version of a scholarly
article or research output in a repository or other online platform.
Typically, this is done after the work has been published in a
subscription-based journal. Authors retain the rights to their work and
can share it publicly without violating copyright restrictions. Green
open access enhances the visibility and accessibility of research
outputs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Diamond Open Access (Diamond Route):</li>
</ul>
<p>Also known as âgoldâ open access, it involves making research outputs

<h3 id="communities-of-practice-related-to-open-science">Communities of practice related to open science<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#communities-of-practice-related-to-open-science"></a>
</h3>
<p>Over the years, Latin America has seen a substantial growth in
communities of practice. These groups are self-organized and
self-sustained gatherings of individuals bound by a common interest or
passion, learning and improving collectively through regular interaction
(Etienne and Beverly Wenger-Trayne, 2015). In Latin America, many of
such communities focus specifically on bridging the gender gap in STEM
(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), on imparting skills
related to computational tools, or on educating about open science tools
and practices. While institutional approaches play a crucial role in
setting policies and frameworks, leveraging the strengths of communities
of practice may enhance the dissemination and adoption of open science
practices at a more personal, relatable, and community-driven level.
Some of these strengths are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bottom-Up Approach: Communities of practice are driven by
individuals who are genuinely passionate about the subject matter. This
grassroots involvement ensures a more organic and authentic
dissemination of open science principles, engaging individuals on a
personal level.</p></li>
<li><p>Inclusivity and Engagement: Communities of practice foster
inclusivity, encouraging diverse participation and engagement from
individuals of various backgrounds, experiences, and expertise levels.
The inclusion facilitates a broader understanding of open science and
encourages a wider range of people to adopt and promote these
practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Peer Learning and Collaboration: In these communities, members
learn from each other, share experiences, and collectively work towards
a common goal. This collaborative learning environment fosters a sense
of belonging and encourages the adoption of open practices through
shared knowledge and mutual support.</p></li>
<li><p>Tailored and Relevant Initiatives: Communities of practice have
the flexibility to tailor initiatives and activities to suit the
specific needs and contexts of their members. They can focus on topics
that are relevant and directly applicable to the community, ensuring
that the dissemination of open science is relatable and
actionable.</p></li>
<li><p>Agility and Adaptability: Communities of practice are agile and
adaptable to changing circumstances, technological advancements, and
emerging trends in the scientific community. They can quickly respond to
evolving requirements, making them more responsive and effective in
promoting open science practices in real-time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these communities are:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metadocencia.org/" class="external-link"><strong>Metadocencia</strong></a>
works to make the production, communication, and application of
scientific and technical knowledge equitable globally. MetaDocencia is
an international community of researchers and educators dedicated to
equipping individuals and organizations from Spanish-speaking regions
and beyond by providing open science resources, delivering professional
development training, and supporting infrastructure design and
implementation. We are convinced that elevating scientific and technical
capacity in Latin America will increase equity more broadly in society
and accelerate innovation across the globe.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://openlifesci.org/" class="external-link">OLS</a>, <a href="https://2i2c.org/" class="external-link">2i2c</a> and the support of NASA, MetaDocencia
joins the initiative to transform science and technology to open
practices. To help build a culture of open science, NASA is promoting
the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/marshall/nasa-boosts-open-science-through-innovative-training/" class="external-link">Open-Source
Science Initiative (OSSI)</a>, a comprehensive program of activities to
support the advancement of science toward openness. As part of this
program, MetaDocencia will contribute with its experience in training,
the scientific expertise of its community, and its Spanish-language
competence and contextualization knowldege to work with Spanish-speaking
scientific and technical communities.</p>
<p><a href="https://idatosabiertos.org/" class="external-link"><strong>Latin American Open
Data Initiative (ILDA)</strong></a> promotes inclusive development,
public and social innovation, and open knowledge through openness, the
use of public data, and the active participation of the communities
involved in Latin America.</p>
<p><a href="https://conectorial.netlify.app/" class="external-link"><strong>Conectorial</strong></a>
is a non-profit community of open access journal publishers and research
professionals dedicated to developing resources and means to foster
scientific production and promote the growth of Open Access journals in
Latin America. It provides a space where people related to the edition,
management, and promotion of scientific Open Access journals, as well as
research and publication of articles can meet to exchange knowledge.</p>
<p>The collaborative environment fostered by communities of practice not
only facilitates the emergence of research projects but also amplifies
their visibility and relevance. By encouraging the exchange of knowledge
and experiences among experts and passionate professionals, these
communities create a fertile ground for the incubation and execution of
innovative ideas. Moreover, by providing a space for interdisciplinary
collaboration, they allow diverse disciplines to converge and mutually
enrich one another, thus enhancing the quality and impact of research
projects. This interactive collaboration benefits not only those
directly involved but also contributes to the advancement of knowledge
and the progress of society as a whole.</p>
<p>There are some examples of projects fostered by the participation in
communities of practice:</p>
<p><a href="https://ciencia-abierta-en-latinoamerica.netlify.app/" class="external-link">Mapping
open-science communities, organizations, and events in Latin
America</a>. Motivated by the need for a centralized hub of information
useful not only to us but that could potentially help other individuals
and communities. So we decided to create a repository that collects and
centralizes open resources with a focus on Latin America, such as
communities, events, workshops, and funders.</p>

practice <a href="https://www.metadocencia.org/en/post/communities-of-practice-la/" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>

<li><p>The different initiatives promoting open science in Latin America
conceive knowledge as a communal asset that should not be tied to
finantial gain.</p></li>
<li><p>For fostering the implementation of open practices, the
institutions need to reevaluate policies regarding publication rewards,
emphasizing the need to shift towards an evaluation centered on social
relevance rather than impact factor metrics.</p></li>
<li><p>Community-driven open science initiatives contribute to a more
organic and authentic dissemination of open science principles. They
facilitate inclusivity, peer learning, and tailored initiatives, making

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our

    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
