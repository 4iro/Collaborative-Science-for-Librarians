## Description

This 3-hour lesson is organized into three main sections covering: open, collaborative, and inclusive science; FAIR and CARE principles; and Latin American initiatives and practices.
We will introduce open science concepts and principles, with emphasis on applying FAIR principles to library work in order to make data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reproducible. With examples from Latin American data governance projects to show many paths to open science, we will also include the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance to highlight the significance of ethical and responsible work with data for fostering self-determination. The lesson will present concepts of community-building and collaboration in open research, relating them to local content sources such as ILDA, Latindex, the National System of Digital Repositories, and the Argentinean mapping of citizen science initiatives. We will also share our experience teaching diverse audiences at MetaDocencia, an inclusive community to develop evidence-based open teaching practices and materials and build technical and research capacity across Spanish-speaking countries. We will discuss resources for ongoing, independent learning after the workshop, including The Turing Way and the NASA TOPS open training (to be released), which were created by a diverse group of open science practitioners.
