## Description

This 3-hour lesson is organized into three main sections covering: open, collaborative, and inclusive science; FAIR and CARE principles; and Latin American initiatives and practices.
The declaration of 2023 as the Year of Open Science by NASA and other federal US agencies reflects the belief that open science is a pillar to ensure information access and the democratization of the scientific process. As Chelle Gentemann, program scientist for NASA’s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission, recently shared in Nature, “I realized that open science isn’t just about tools. Open-science innovation is being driven by a global community with diverse perspectives. The scientific questions are more interesting and nuanced, the solutions better.” We want to share how open science communities, especially those from marginalized regions like Latin America, actively participate in implementing, educating, and disseminating open practices and resources. Open science communities and organizations are settings where researchers and societal stakeholders can meet to achieve results that are not only technically but also socially meaningful through the use of transparent, reproducible, and verifiable methods with contributors from different regions, disciplines, and social realities. Non-native English-speaking researchers, educators, and professionals frequently face difficulties obtaining the resources they need to carry out their work, being limited by lack of funding, language barriers, and geographical limitations. Bringing experiences from Spanish-speaking communities of practice, we will work with librarians to discuss the challenges faced by such communities when dealing with data and other resources that are only available in English, making language an accessibility barrier. We will discuss aspects of how open science practices may help marginalized communities of scholars get past barriers caused by language, socioeconomic status, and other factors in order to foster a more inclusive scientific community.
We will introduce open science concepts and principles, with great emphasis on applying FAIR principles to library work in order to make data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reproducible. With examples from Latin American data governance projects to show many paths to open science, we will also include the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance to highlight the significance of ethical and responsible work with data for fostering self-determination. The lesson will present concepts of community-building and collaboration in open research, relating them to local content sources such as ILDA, Latindex, the National System of Digital Repositories and the Argentinean mapping of citizen science initiatives. We will also share our experience teaching diverse audiences at MetaDocencia, an inclusive community to develop evidence-based open teaching practices and materials and build technical and research capacity across Spanish-speaking countries. We will discuss resources for ongoing, independent learning after the workshop, including The Turing Way and the NASA TOPS open training (to be released), which were created by a diverse group of open science practitioners.

This lesson is a template lesson that uses [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench].

## Create a new repository from this template

To use this template to start a new lesson repository, 
make sure you're logged into Github.   
Visit https://github.com/carpentries/workbench-template-md/generate
and follow the instructions.
Checking the 'Include all branches' option will save some time waiting for the first website build
when your new repository is initialised.

If you have any questions, contact [@zkamvar](https://github.com/zkamvar)

## Configure a new lesson

Follow the steps below to
complete the initial configuration of a new lesson repository built from this template:

1. **Make sure GitHub Pages is activated:**
   navigate to _Settings_,
   select _Pages_ from the left sidebar,
   and make sure that `gh-pages` is selected as the branch to build from.
   If no `gh-pages` branch is available, check _Actions_ to see if the first
   website build workflows are still running.
   The branch should become available when those have completed.
1. **Adjust the `config.yaml` file:**
   this file contains global parameters for your lesson site.
   Individual fields within the file are documented with comments (beginning with `#`)
   At minimum, you should adjust all the fields marked 'FIXME':
   - `title`
   - `created`
   - `keywords`
   - `life_cycle` (the default, _pre-alpha_, is the appropriate for brand new lessons)
   - `contact`
1. **Annotate the repository** with site URL and topic tags:
   navigate back to the repository landing page and
   click on the gear wheel/cog icon (similar to ⚙️) 
   at the top-right of the _About_ box.
   Check the "Use your GitHub Pages website" option,
   and [add some keywords and other annotations to describe your lesson](https://cdh.carpentries.org/the-carpentries-incubator.html#topic-tags)
   in the _Topics_ field.
   At minimum, these should include:
   - `lesson`
   - the life cycle of the lesson (e.g. `pre-alpha`)
   - the human language the lesson is written in (e.g. `deutsch`)
1. **Adjust the 
   `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `LICENSE.md` files**
   as appropriate for your project.
   -  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: 
      if you are using this template for a project outside The Carpentries,
      you should adjust this file to describe 
      who should be contacted with Code of Conduct reports,
      and how those reports will be handled.
   -  `CONTRIBUTING.md`:
      depending on the current state and maturity of your project,
      the contents of the template Contributing Guide may not be appropriate.
      You should adjust the file to help guide contributors on how best
      to get involved and make an impact on your lesson.
   -  `LICENSE.md`:
      in line with the terms of the CC-BY license,
      you should ensure that the copyright information 
      provided in the license file is accurate for your project.
1. **Update this README with 
   [relevant information about your lesson](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/26-external.html#readme)**
   and delete this section.
