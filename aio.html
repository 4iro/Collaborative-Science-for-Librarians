<p>Using correct names and pronouns (e.g.Â âshe/herâ) is important to
setting a tone of respect. Learning these is hard to do quickly, so we
recommend displaying it prominently during the workshop.</p>
<p>In an online workshop, give everyone a moment to update their display
name to reflect how they would like to be addressed.</p>
<p>At an in-person event, we recommend supplying name tags and markers,
or using plain paper to create table-displayed name placards.</p>
<p>Note that pronouns are personal and some participants might prefer
not to share them. Do not force people to share their pronouns.</p>

<p>The main objective of this training is to help participants
understand the motivations, principles, and potential benefits of open
science for marginalized communities.</p>
<p>During this training, we will introduce the concepts of open science
and open practices, along with the motivations behind them and the
challenges that many communities face when attempting to implement these
principles. Furthermore, we will elaborate on the concept of digital
accessibility, FAIR principles, and CARE principles, and discuss their
impact on peopleâs participation within the scientific community.
Additionally, we will showcase various open science initiatives in Latin
America and the diverse practices they employ to overcome the barriers
faced by marginalized communities in the context of science and
education.</p>
<p>By the end of this training, the participants will have acquire
information that will allow them to assess the levels of accessibility
of different digital resources and virtual events. They will also be
equipped to apply best practices for fostering a more inclusive research
network for non-native English speakers.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The declaration of 2023 as the Year of Open Science by NASA and other
federal US agencies reflects the belief that open science is a pillar to
ensure information access and the democratization of the scientific
process.</p>
<p>As Chelle Gentemann, program scientist for NASAâs Transform to Open
Science (TOPS) mission, recently shared in Nature,</p>
<p><em>âI realized that open science isnât just about tools.
Open-science innovation is being driven by a global community with
diverse perspectives. The scientific questions are more interesting and
nuanced, the solutions betterâ</em></p>
<p>Open science communities and organizations serve as platforms where
researchers and societal stakeholders converge to achieve results that
are not only technically sound but also socially significant. This is
made possible through the application of transparent, reproducible, and
verifiable methods, engaging contributors from diverse regions,
disciplines, and social contexts. However, non-native English-speaking
researchers, educators, and professionals often encounter challenges in
accessing the resources necessary to conduct their work, primarily due
to limited funding, language barriers, and geographical constraints.</p>
<p>Our objective is to shed light on how open science communities,
particularly those in marginalized regions like Latin America, actively
engage in implementing, teaching, and disseminating open practices and
resources. Drawing upon experiences from Spanish-speaking communities of
practice, we aim to collaborate with librarians to explore the specific
challenges faced by these communities when dealing with data and other
resources primarily available in English, which creates a language-based
accessibility barrier. Through these discussions, we intend to address
how open science practices can aid marginalized communities of scholars
in overcoming obstacles related to language, socioeconomic status, and
other factors, ultimately fostering a more inclusive scientific
community.</p>

<p>Librarians play an indispensable role in advancing open science as
facilitators, supporting researchers, and significantly contributing to
the principles of collaboration and inclusivity. These values are
crucial as they enable global participation in scientific endeavors,
ultimately contributing to the democratization of knowledge.
Additionally, they aid in combating the spread of misinformation and
disinformation, addressing systemic inequalities, and challenging the
monopolization of wealth, knowledge, and power. Furthermore, they guide
scientific efforts towards addressing pressing social issues.</p>
<p>Throughout this lesson, we will explore the implications of adopting
more open and ethical research practices, establishing an environment
where scientific information is accessible to all, and increasing the
visibility and impact of scientific publications. Itâs important to
acknowledge that open science presents challenges, and librarians must
be proactive in addressing these obstacles to ensure that it does not
exacerbate existing barriers.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The core aspects of Open Science are closely related to Article 27 of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations, which
acknowledges peopleâs right to participate in scientific progress and
enjoy its benefits. Open Science aims to make science accessible and
collaborative for the benefit of society as a whole, aligning with this
right.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>While there are several definitions of open science, in this lesson,
we will follow the one provided by the UNESCO recommendations for Open
Science which states that it is a movement aimed at enhancing
accessibility, efficiency, democracy, and transparency in scientific
research.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This approach is underpinned by unprecedented advancements in digital
technology and seeks to make information, data, and research findings
more accessible through open access and more reliable through open
data.</p>
<p>A fundamental component is the active participation of all
stakeholders, including society at large, to foster increased
collaboration and transparency in the field of science. It seeks to
involve social actors beyond the traditional scientific community by
opening up the processes of creating, evaluating, and communicating
scientific knowledge.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Although many researchers use these terms interchangeably, and we
will do so in this lesson, a <em>replication</em> is a study where an
independent group of researchers reproduces the methodologies of a
previous work, collects the data, and analyzes it following the
procedures of the original study to see if they reach the same results.
It assesses the consistency and generalizability of the findings. A
<em>reproduction</em>, on the other hand, occurs when a group of
independent researchers analyzes data previously collected by a
different group, using those researchersâ analysis plan, to determine if
they reach the same result. It verifies the validity of the
findings.</p>
<p>Reproducibility and replicability are among the core objectives of
science. However, for this to be possible, researchers need to describe
their methods and processes in ways that others can repeat them. Open
science practices make it possible for scientists to share the different
stages of their workflow, making them accessible to other
researchers.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Implementing open practices in the scientific community is motivated
by a range of factors that aim to enhance the quality, transparency,
accessibility, and societal impact of research.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="social-impact">Social impact<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#social-impact"></a>

<p>Open science involves an unavoidable cultural shift. It ensures that
research processes, methods, and data are transparent and easily
accessible to others. This transparency facilitates the verification and
reproducibility of research, enhancing the reliability of scientific
findings.</p>
<p>Open science practices can reduce barriers between researchers and
other stakeholders, such as the public, policymakers, and practitioners,
by offering them access to the different stages of the research
workflow. This engagement has the potential to foster public trust in
science and promote decision-making based on evidence.</p>

<p>Open practices help level the playing field for researchers and
institutions that may have limited access to expensive
subscription-based journals or research databases. Open access and open
data initiatives promote inclusivity and equal opportunity for
researchers, regardless of their affiliation or location.</p>
<p>These practices can promote empowering opportunities for researchers,
celebrating diversity and inclusion, in contrast to closed and
individual-centered data analysis approaches.</p>

<h3 id="the-role-of-english-as-an-interchange-language-in-open-science">The role of English as an interchange language in open science<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-role-of-english-as-an-interchange-language-in-open-science"></a>
</h3>
<p>English is one of the most widely spoken and understood languages
globally, which is why using English as a common language increases the
accessibility of scientific research to a broader international audience
and allows researchers from diverse linguistic backgrounds to
collaborate and communicate effectively.</p>
<p>However, while English serves as a valuable interchange language,
making it the dominant language of science has a negative impact on
non-English-speaking communities.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="the-bias-produced-by-the-language-gap">The Bias Produced by the Language Gap<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-bias-produced-by-the-language-gap"></a>
</h4>
<p>For those whose native language is not English, the language is a
barrier to participate fully in discussions, publish research, or
collaborate with English-speaking researchers. This can lead to
underrepresentation of valuable contributions. It also hinders the
understanding and engagement of individuals with science.</p>
<p>Language is deeply intertwined with culture. By prioritizing English,
we risk embedding cultural biases into scientific knowledge,
marginalizing perspectives and practices from non-English-speaking
regions. It can also reinforce power dynamics favoring English-speaking
countries interests and priorities rather than reflecting the global
spectrum of challenges and needs. It can influence decision-making,
funding allocation, and the overall direction of scientific
research.</p>
<p>For non-English-speaking communities, learning the language is often
reserved for people in a privileged position. Not everyone has equal
access to the resources needed to acquire a second language. This
creates an inherent bias towards individuals with better access to
educational materials, funds, and even time, further exacerbating global
inequalities in scientific participation and representation.</p>
<p>At the same time, translation is a laborious and costly process that
most often falls on the non-English speaker. One common practice in
scientific journals in different languages is the translation of
abstracts into English to enhance the visibility of the work and
accessibility for individuals who only speak English. This practice is
prevalent in most Latin American and Chinese journals, while it is
extremely infrequent for English-language journals.</p>

<h3 id="the-socio-economic-limitations">The socio-economic limitations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-socio-economic-limitations"></a>
</h3>
<p>Being a researcher in a low to middle income country (LMIC) can
present several barriers to adopting open science practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited Access to Resources:</li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers in LMICs often lack access to necessary resources such as
high-speed internet, computing infrastructure, software, and relevant
literature. Open science heavily relies on digital platforms and
resources, and the absence of these can hinder their adoption.</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial constraints:</li>
</ul>
<p>Open access publishing, attending open science-related conferences,
or accessing open educational resources often incur costs and the
financial burden may limit the researchers participation in open science
practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of Funding and Support:</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, research funding is scarce. The limited
availability of grants or funding for open science initiatives may
discourage researchers from actively participating or investing time in
adopting these practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of training opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>Awareness and understanding of open science practices may be lacking
or insufficient in LMICs due to limited training opportunities.
Researchers are not often familiar with the benefits or methodologies
associated with open science.</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing Pressures and Incentives:</li>
</ul>
<p>Many academic systems place a high emphasis on publishing in
well-established, often subscription-based, journals. Researchers in
LMICs frequently face pressure to conform to traditional publishing
practices rather than exploring open access options due to concerns
about career progression and recognition.</p>
<ul>
<li>Policy and Institutional Constraints:</li>
</ul>
<p>Some institutions or governments in low to middle income countries do
not have established policies or frameworks supportive of open science.
The lack of a conducive environment or encouragement from the
authorities can impede the integration of open practices.</p>
<p>Addressing these barriers necessitates concerted efforts from the
global scientific community, including providing financial support,
improving digital infrastructure, offering training programs, promoting
multilingualism, and advocating for policies that facilitate open
science adoption in all regions.</p>
<p>Access to Paid Resources and Funding: Access to scientific journals
and paid databases can be costly and often beyond the reach of those
with limited resources. Participation in Conferences: Attending
scientific conferences is a crucial part of collaboration and research
dissemination. However, the associated costs, such as travel and
accommodation, can be prohibitive for individuals with low incomes.
Family responsibilities: Childcare or caring for elderly family members
often have significant time constraints. This can make it challenging
for researchers to participate and collaborate in scientific activities
as they need to balance family responsibilities with their scientific
work.</p>

<p>What you need to know is that there are three sections required for a
valid Carpentries lesson template:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<code>questions</code> are displayed at the beginning of the episode
to prime the learner for the content.</li>
<li>
<code>objectives</code> are the learning objectives for an episode
displayed with the questions.</li>
<li>
<code>keypoints</code> are displayed at the end of the episode to
reinforce the objectives.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can use pandoc markdown for static figures with the following
syntax:</p>
<p><code>![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for accessibility purposes'}</code></p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>One of our episodes contains <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> equations when describing how to
create dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe
this:</p>
<p><code>$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$</code> becomes: <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}\)</span></p>
<p>Cool, right?</p>

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.
    Considering that I am not _currently_ using this tracking because I do not
    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
  <script>
    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
    /* tracker methods like "setCustomDimension" should be called before "trackPageView" */
    _paq.push(["setDocumentTitle", document.domain + "/" + document.title]);
    _paq.push(["setDomains", ["*.preview.carpentries.org","*.datacarpentry.github.io","*.datacarpentry.org","*.librarycarpentry.github.io","*.librarycarpentry.org","*.swcarpentry.github.io", "*.carpentries.github.io"]]);
    _paq.push(["setDoNotTrack", true]);
    _paq.push(["disableCookies"]);
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
    _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
    (function() {
          var u="https://carpentries.matomo.cloud/";
          _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u+'matomo.php']);
          _paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);
          var d=document, g=d.createElement('script'), s=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
          g.async=true; g.src='https://cdn.matomo.cloud/carpentries.matomo.cloud/matomo.js'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
        })();
