## Introduction

Librarians play an indispensable role in advancing open science as facilitators, supporting researchers, and significantly contributing to the principles of collaboration and inclusivity. These values are crucial as they enable global participation in scientific endeavors, ultimately contributing to the democratization of knowledge. Additionally, they aid in combating the spread of misinformation and disinformation, addressing systemic inequalities, and challenging the monopolization of wealth, knowledge, and power. Furthermore, they guide scientific efforts toward addressing pressing social issues.

Throughout this lesson, we will explore the implications of adopting more open and ethical research practices, establishing an environment where scientific information is accessible to all, and increasing the visibility and impact of scientific publications. It's important to acknowledge that open science presents challenges, and librarians must be proactive in addressing these obstacles to ensure that it does not exacerbate existing barriers.

## What is Open Science?

The core aspects of Open Science are closely related to Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations, which acknowledges people's right to participate in scientific progress and enjoy its benefits. Open Science aims to make science accessible and collaborative for the benefit of society as a whole, aligning with this right.

While there are several definitions of open science, in this lesson, we will follow the one provided by the UNESCO recommendations for Open Science which states that it is a movement aimed at enhancing accessibility, efficiency, democracy, and transparency in scientific research.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This approach is underpinned by unprecedented advancements in digital technology and seeks to make information, data, and research findings more accessible through open access and more reliable through open data. 

A fundamental component is the active participation of all stakeholders, including society at large, to foster increased collaboration and transparency in the field of science. It seeks to involve social actors beyond the traditional scientific community by opening up the processes of creating, evaluating, and communicating scientific knowledge. 


## What are reproducibility and replicability


Although many researchers use these terms interchangeably, and we will do so in this lesson, a _replication_ is a study where an independent group of researchers reproduces the methodologies of previous work, collects the data, and analyzes it following the procedures of the original study to see if they reach the same results. It assesses the consistency and generalizability of the findings. A _reproduction_, on the other hand, occurs when a group of independent researchers analyzes data previously collected by a different group, using those researchers' analysis plan, to determine if they reach the same result. It verifies the validity of the findings.

Reproducibility and replicability are among the core objectives of science. However, for this to be possible, researchers need to describe their methods and processes in ways that others can repeat them. Open science practices make it possible for scientists to share the different stages of their workflow, making them accessible to other researchers.



## The motivation behind open science

Implementing open practices in the scientific community is motivated by a range of factors that aim to enhance the quality, transparency, accessibility, and societal impact of research.


### Social Impact 

Open science involves an unavoidable cultural shift. It ensures that research processes, methods, and data are transparent and easily accessible to others. This transparency facilitates the verification and reproducibility of research, enhancing the reliability of scientific findings. 

Open science practices can reduce barriers between researchers and other stakeholders, such as the public, policymakers, and practitioners, by offering them access to the different stages of the research workflow. This engagement has the potential to foster public trust in science and promote decision-making based on evidence.

### Equity and Inclusivity

Open practices help level the playing field for researchers and institutions that may have limited access to expensive subscription-based journals or research databases. Open access and open data initiatives promote inclusivity and equal opportunity for researchers, regardless of their affiliation or location.

These practices can promote empowering opportunities for researchers, celebrating diversity and inclusion, in contrast to closed and individual-centered data analysis approaches.

### Global Collaboration

Open practices enable researchers from diverse geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds to collaborate more effectively. It facilitates cross-border collaborations and the pooling of resources and expertise, leading to a broader and more inclusive scientific community. It can also provide greater opportunities for interdisciplinary research across institutions worldwide. 


### Accelerating Scientific Progress 

Collaboration drives innovation. Open practices promote collaboration and knowledge sharing, allowing researchers to build upon existing work. This increases efficiency by reusing data, reducing costs, and avoiding duplicated work. This accelerates the pace of scientific discovery. 

Greater efficiency and speed. Open data practices also drive efficiency by enabling real-time, data-driven decision-making (Adams, 2018; SPARC, n.d.). The sharing of data reduces transaction costs; increases reproducibility and reuse of data; decreases redundancy; and drives greater transparency, heightened efficiency, and accelerated sustainable innovation

## Challenges for adopting open science in Marginalized Communities

### The role of English as an interchange language in open science

English is one of the most widely spoken and understood languages globally, which is why using English as a common language increases the accessibility of scientific research to a broader international audience and allows researchers from diverse linguistic backgrounds to collaborate and communicate effectively.

However, while English serves as a valuable interchange language, making it the dominant language of science has a negative impact on non-English-speaking communities. 

#### The Bias Produced by the Language Gap 

For those whose native language is not English, the language is a barrier to participating fully in discussions, publishing research, or collaborating with English-speaking researchers. This can lead to the underrepresentation of valuable contributions. It also hinders the understanding and engagement of individuals with science. 

Language is deeply intertwined with culture. By prioritizing English, we risk embedding cultural biases into scientific knowledge, marginalizing perspectives and practices from non-English-speaking regions. It can also reinforce power dynamics favoring English-speaking countries' interests and priorities rather than reflecting the global spectrum of challenges and needs. It can influence decision-making, funding allocation, and the overall direction of scientific research.

For non-English-speaking communities, learning the language is often reserved for people in a privileged position. Not everyone has equal access to the resources needed to acquire a second language. This creates an inherent bias towards individuals with better access to educational materials, funds, and even time, further exacerbating global inequalities in scientific participation and representation.

At the same time, translation is a laborious and costly process that most often falls on the non-English speaker. One common practice in scientific journals in different languages is the translation of abstracts into English to enhance the visibility of the work and accessibility for individuals who only speak English. This practice is prevalent in most Latin American and Chinese journals, while it is extremely infrequent in English-language journals.

### The socio-economic limitations

Being a researcher in a low to middle-income country (LMIC) can present several barriers to adopting open science practices:

- Limited Access to Resources:

Researchers in LMICs often lack access to necessary resources such as high-speed internet, computing infrastructure, software, and relevant literature. Open science heavily relies on digital platforms and resources, and the absence of these can hinder their adoption.

- Financial constraints:

Open-access publishing, attending open science-related conferences, or accessing open educational resources often incur costs and the financial burden may limit the researchers' participation in open science practices.  

- Lack of Funding and Support:

At the same time, research funding is scarce. The limited availability of grants or funding for open science initiatives may discourage researchers from actively participating or investing time in adopting these practices.

- Lack of training opportunities

Awareness and understanding of open science practices may be lacking or insufficient in LMICs due to limited training opportunities. Researchers are not often familiar with the benefits or methodologies associated with open science.

- Publishing Pressures and Incentives:

Many academic systems place a high emphasis on publishing in well-established, often subscription-based, journals. Researchers in LMICs frequently face pressure to conform to traditional publishing practices rather than exploring open access options due to concerns about career progression and recognition. 

- Policy and Institutional Constraints:

Some institutions or governments in low to middle-income countries do not have established policies or frameworks supportive of open science. The lack of a conducive environment or encouragement from the authorities can impede the integration of open practices.

Addressing these barriers necessitates concerted efforts from the global scientific community, including providing financial support, improving digital infrastructure, offering training programs, promoting multilingualism, and advocating for policies that facilitate open science adoption in all regions.
