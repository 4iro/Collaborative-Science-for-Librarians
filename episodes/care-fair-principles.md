## Digital accesibility in open science

In educational and research institutions, groups are characterized by a diverse range of cultural backgrounds, gender identities, native languages, socioeconomic statuses, ages, abilities, among other attributes. Individuals can experience multiple forms of discrimination or privilege simultaneously, based on these intersecting social identities.  

As a fundamental human right, digital accesibility seeks to eliminate attitudinal, policy, and social barriers to enable all individuals to fully engage in the digital world.

Digital accessibility ensures that technologies and information are available and effectively usable by all individuals, including those with disabilities. Its promotion fosters autonomy, social inclusion, and equal opportunities in the digital society. It benefits individuals with disabilities, older adults, those with limited technological literacy, and those who rely on assistive devices.

Understanding digital accessibility in the library environment is essential to provide all users equal access to information and online services. Promoting digital accessibility and removing barriers ensures all users can fully benefit from digital resources. It also enables librarians to provide the necessary assistance to reference accessible information and promotes the intellectual production of new resources considering aspects that favor accessibility.

## Promoting digital accesibility in research

Librarians play a crucial role in improving digital accessibility by providing support, resources, and guidance. There are several ways to contribute to digital content becoming more inclusive.

Let's start by identifying some key elements of digital accessibility:

- Text content should be clear, concise, and formatted in a simple manner. This helps users to easily understand and navigate information.

- Images should provide alternative text or alt text that describes the content and function of the image, making them accessible to individuals who use screen readers or have visual impairments.

- Color combinations should have sufficient contrast to ensure readability for all users. This is especially important for text and background colors to accommodate individuals with visual impairments.

- Videos should include subtitles and audio content. Subtitles provide a text-based version of spoken content, benefiting individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.

- Transcripts for video and audio content should be available. Transcripts provide a written version of spoken content, making it accessible to those who prefer to read or need an alternative format.

There are different ways in which librarian's can contribute to enhance accessibility for researchers:

- Teaching about digital accessibility best practices. Help researchers create accessible documents, websites, and presentations. Also, guide on using accessible research tools and software.

- Curate and promote accessible resources, databases, and platforms. 

- Provide consultations for researchers who need assistance making their research materials and presentations accessible. 

- Make accessibility tools and software available to researchers. 

- Offer document conversion services to make research materials accessible. 

- Ensure that library spaces, including computer labs and study areas, are physically accessible to researchers with disabilities.

- Create channels for researchers to provide feedback on the accessibility issues they encounter. 

Bear in mind that thinking about accessibility helps create and promote digital products and interfaces that are intuitive, flexible, and usable for a diverse audience, ultimately improving the experience for all individuals.

## FAIR principles and data accessibility in open data practices.

While digital accessibility focuses on making digital content inclusive and user-friendly, data accessibility is concerned with making data sets, databases, and research findings open and accessible to researchers, policymakers, and the public. 

Data accessibility involves adopting practices such as the ones described in the FAIR Principles. These are a set of guidelines and best practices designed to improve reusability of data, which refers to the ability to use existing data for different purposes beyond the original intent of its collection. It involves making data understandable, well-documented, organized, and stored in a way that allows others to effectively utilize it in various contexts and for different analyses, experiments, or applications. The great value of data lies in their ability to be reusable in order to accelerate scientific discoveries and save costs in their creation. 
The FAIR acronym stands for findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of data (or any digital object), metadata (information about that digital object), and infrastructure, particularly in the area of data and scientific research.

### Data should be _Findable_

The FAIR principles emphasizes that data and associated metadata should be easily discoverable and accessible by both humans and computers. This ensures that researchers, scientists, and practitioners can efficiently locate the data they need for their work.


#### A globally unique and persistent identifier for data and metadata

In order to be findable, (Meta) data should have assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier. These identifiers, which consist of an internal link, remove ambiguity in the meaning of the published data, they make it findable, they allow computers to interpret it in a meaningful way, and they help the people who reuse it to properly cite it. Many data repositories will automatically generate them when you store a datasets, but you can also use registry services that use algorithms to guarantee the uniqueness of the generated identifiers.

A few examples:

- [https://orcid.org/](https://orcid.org/)
- [https://www.doi.org](https://www.doi.org)
- [https://identifiers.org](https://identifiers.org)
- [https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/](https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/)

#### The importance of a descriptive metadata

Metadata provide essential context about the data, describing its content, structure, source, and other pertinent information. Extensive and descriptive metadata makes it possible to automatize some routine tasks which currently demand a lot of attention from researchers. For example, machine-readable metadata enable automated discovery, indexing, and retrieval of datasets, making it easier for both humans and machines to locate relevant data efficiently. They should be able to locate any dataset based on the information provided by their metadata, so the richer the better!
Typically, the metadata and the dataset are stored as distinct files. It is important to establish a clear link between both of them by referencing the globally unique and persistent identifier within the metadata. 

Examples of metadata frameworks:

- [https://www.dtls.nl/fair-data/find-fair-data-tools/](https://www.dtls.nl/fair-data/find-fair-data-tools/)
- [https://isa-tools.org/](https://isa-tools.org/)


#### Searchable resources to register or index data

Merely having an identifier and detailed metadata is not enough. The highest quality and most comprehensive datasets or digital resources are essentially useless if users are unaware of their existence.The process of ensuring discoverability of digital resources, particularly scholarly research data, is a critical step in facilitating efficient access and utilization of valuable information. There are various methods that address this issue:

- Indexing: Utilizing search engine indexing, as demonstrated by search engines like Google, is a potent method. Search engines send out crawlers that analyze web content, index it, and make it searchable. However, for scholarly research data, specialized indexing approaches tailored to the academic domain are necessary.

- Specialized Repositories and Catalogs: Uploading data to specialized repositories or catalogs relevant to the specific field of research enhances discoverability within the target audience. Researchers often turn to these curated platforms to find relevant data for their projects.

- Cross-Linking and References: Creating links from related publications, datasets, or similar resources to the target dataset or resource can significantly boost discoverability. Academic papers that cite or reference the data also indirectly enhance its visibility.


### Data should be _Accesible_

Within the FAIR principles, making the data accessible refers to making it easily available and retrievable to users and systems. It implies: 

- Clear Access Protocols: the protocol (HTTP, FTP, SMTP…) should be free (no-cost) and open (-sourced) and thus globally implementable to facilitate data retrieval and should ensure Metadata is accessible, even when the data are no longer available

- Data Repositories: Storing data in reputable and accessible repositories or data centers, which offer standardized access methods (e.g., APIs, web interfaces), enhances accessibility.

- Standardized Formats: Using widely accepted and standard data formats, such as Comma-Separated Values files, makes it easier for both humans and machines to access and interpret the data.

- Compliance with Legal and Ethical Standards: Ensuring that data access complies with legal, ethical, and privacy standards to protect sensitive information while enabling appropriate accessibility.

### Data should be _Interoperable_

Data should be easily integrated with other datasets, applications, workflows of analysis and processing. For this, 

- Use a language to represent information that has precisely defined syntax and grammar, is shared and accessible so that others can learn it, and can be used in multiple scenarios (e.g. RDF, JSON LD).

### Data should be _Reusable_

The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimize the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings:

- Described with accurate and relevant details.
With a clear and easy-to-understand license for usage.
- Linked to its complete history and origin.
- Adhering to the standards relevant to its field.
