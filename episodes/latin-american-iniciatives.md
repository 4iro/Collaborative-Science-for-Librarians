:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- Which open practices do Latin American initiatives apply to promote an inclusive research environment?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

After attending this training, participants will be able to:

- Identify Latin American initiatives that have successfully promoted inclusive research practices for non-native English speakers.
- Describe the open practices that Latin American initiatives are employing to create a more inclusive research environment.
- Assess how they contribute to increase participation, knowledge exchange, and cross-cultural collaboration.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction

In this episode, building upon themes explored in previous installments, we will delve into the nuanced landscape of Open Science, specifically focusing on Latin America. While celebrating the region's contributions, we will also confront the unique challenges it faces on the path to a more inclusive and equitable scientific community.

We will cover the experiences and developments of researchers, institutions, and communities at the forefront of change. We will unpack the key components that constitute a more inclusive and equitable approach to Open Science and shed light on the innovative strategies and collaborations shaping the future of research in Latin America.

## Overview of Latin American initiatives

There is a significant focus, on regarding knowledge as a communal asset for Latin America and the Caribbean on open access, overseen by the academic community, as a shared resource devoid of financial gain. This is further supported by suggestions to reevaluate evaluation policies that rely on publication incentives linked to impact metrics. Such policies have the potential to impede local autonomy in shaping research agendas while discouraging the adoption of effective open access practices and research methodologies that involve the wider society. Policies and regulations favor the use of institutional repositories within universities and National Science and Technology Organizations as the primary tools for endorsing and expanding open access initiatives in the region. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout
Latin America regulation of knowledge access: 
 
Peru, Argentina, and Mexico (2013-2014): These countries have opted for a legislative approach to regulate open access policies, enacting specific laws or policies.
Brazil: guidelines supporting open access have been issued in the form of declarations and manifestos, driven by various groups committed to this cause. Additionally, there have been proposed laws (2007 y 2011) related to open access, although they have not yet been enacted.
Chile (2014): recommendations for access and preservation of scientific information and research data have been developed, as detailed in the 2014 Open Data Manual. This has been done with the intention of establishing a research open data policy in the future.
Colombia (2019): has begun to establish general guidelines for the future development of an open science policy since 2019.

The Federated Repository Network of the Region is in the process of establishing this regulatory framework and brings together systems of national repositories from 11 different countries

## Latin American initiatives in open practices

### Non-commercial open access system to journals published in the region
- **Redalyc** offers a vast collection of scientific journals in Spanish and Portuguese, which ensures that research from Latin America is not marginalized by language barriers. 
- **Latindex** indexing and cataloging efforts make it easier for researchers to locate and access relevant resources within their linguistic and regional contexts.
- **SciELO**  includes multilingual journals from Latin America, Spain, Portugal, and other regions.
- **AmeliCA** seeks to address the challenges faced by non-native English speakers by promoting regional publishing, open science, and the development of inclusive infrastructures.
- **Latin America Research Commons** editorial project originated in the Latin American Studies Association (LASA) and its main goal is to ensure the widest possible dissemination of original monographs and journals in all disciplines related to Latin American studies. 

### Open access national systems
Here are some examples of open access national systems from different Latinamerican countries

**Argentina**
- [National System of Digital Repositories](https://repositoriosdigitales.mincyt.gob.ar/) 
- [Open data portal](https://datos.gob.ar/)
- [Citizen Science](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/ciencia/sact/ciencia-ciudadana)

**Bolivia**
- [Open data portal](https://datos.gob.bo/)

**Brasil**

### Communities of practice related to open science
"One possible instrument for the dissemination of open science, potentially with more acceptance from users and a regional perspective, are the communities of practice, which, according to Etienne and Beverly Wenger-Trayne (2015), are self-organized and self-maintained groups of people who share a concern or passion for something they do and learn to do it better as they interact regularly. In recent years, these communities have grown significantly in Latin America, many focusing on reducing the gender gap in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics), such as R-Ladies, PyLadies, GeoChicas, LasdeSistemas, TecnoLatinas, and Women in Bioinformatics and Data Science Latin America. Others aim to transmit skills for teaching computational tools or are dedicated to teaching open science tools and practices, such as MetaDocencia." (https://www.metadocencia.org/en/post/communities-of-practice-la/)

[**Metadocencia**](https://www.metadocencia.org/) works to make the production, communication, and application of scientific and technical knowledge equitable globally.
[**Latin American Open Data Initiative (ILDA)**](https://idatosabiertos.org/) promotes inclusive development, public and social innovation, and open knowledge through openness, the use of public data, and the active participation of the communities involved in Latin America.
[**Conectorial**](https://conectorial.netlify.app/) is a non-profit community of open access journal publishers and research professionals dedicated to developing resources and means to foster scientific production and promote the growth of Open Access journals in Latin America. It provides a space where people related to the edition, management, and promotion of scientific Open Access journals, as well as research and publication of articles can meet to exchange knowledge.


### Networks and  projects
[Mapping open-science communities, organizations, and events in Latin America](https://ciencia-abierta-en-latinoamerica.netlify.app/) Motivated by the need for a centralized hub of information useful not only to us but that could potentially help other individuals and communities. So we decided to create a repository that collects and centralizes open resources with a focus on Latin America, such as communities, events, workshops, and funders.
