:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- Which obstacles related to language, socioeconomic status, and disabilities do marginalized communities experience when attempting to adopt an open science framework?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

After attending this training, participants will be able to:

- Define open science and explain the motivation behind implementing open practices.
- List current challenges with adopting open science for marginalized communities.
- List the benefits marginalized communities receive when collaborative science practices are adopted.

## Introduction

This is a lesson created via The Carpentries Workbench. It is written in
[Pandoc-flavored Markdown][pandoc] for static files (with extension `.md`) and
[R Markdown][r-markdown] for dynamic files that can render code into output
(with extension `.Rmd`). Please refer to the [Introduction to The Carpentries
Workbench][carpentries-workbench] for full documentation.

What you need to know is that there are three sections required for a valid
Carpentries lesson template:

 1. `questions` are displayed at the beginning of the episode to prime the
    learner for the content.
 2. `objectives` are the learning objectives for an episode displayed with
    the questions.
 3. `keypoints` are displayed at the end of the episode to reinforce the
    objectives.

Inline instructor notes can help inform instructors of timing challenges
associated with the lessons. They appear in the "Instructor View"

## DISCUSSION: THINKING ABOUT OPEN SCIENCE BARRIERS

(In groups, 15 minutes): Think about your experience working with open science and answer the following questions:

1. Which limitations or difficulties have you encountered?
2. Do you know any marginalized communities near you?
3. How do you think those difficulties affect the implementation of open science for marginalized communities?

Share your answers on the collaborative document.

## Figures

You can use pandoc markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
